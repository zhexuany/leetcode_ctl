 Leetcode-ctl
 ===========
 
 Leetcode-ctl is a command line controller. The goal of this project is to provide a simple way
 to grab leetcode problem and submit your solution just in terminal. 
 
 #How to use this project
 Althought grabing problem does not require you login, but submiting solution definitely require that.
 Currently, I do not figure a way to login leetcode via your username and password. But this already pushed 
 into todo stack. The only way to provide authentication is of using cookies. You can get these via chrome. 
 I believe there are plenty of tutorials online.
